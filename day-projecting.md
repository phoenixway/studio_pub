#day-projecting
**Main question**.
Do you want to live a day?
**The need to design the day**.
If so, you need to remember that the only way to do this is by realizing a high-level day every day.
Remember that.
* Everything is created twice. Once in a person's head, and once in reality. 
* How are you going to achieve success if you can't even imagine it?
* Either you plan for victory or you plan for failure.
* Designing a day is work. And it requires effort. But almost everything good that will happen today will be based on it.
**Optimal goals are a key component of success**.
- The 3 most important goals of the day, in addition to the obvious: critical, treatment and support
- 3 priority goals #piw
- 3 priority goals #outdoor 
- 3 priority goals #deviceðŸ“± 
- 3 priority goals #hiw 
**Plan WHEN and HOW MUCH TIME to realize the main goals of the day

**Everything else is adjusted to the previous point**.
