## General Approach to Organizing Goals Within a Specific Domain

Let’s assume there is a project, a relatively large goal, or a personal program — I will call this a domain. Regarding the organization of a large number of subprojects, goals, and subgoals, I use the following approach. It is applicable to tactical iterations, strategic programs of any scale, and any projects.
- Domain goals are divided into two sections: component projects and backlog.
- Component projects (or simply projects) are the larger, more substantial goals of the domain that require planning and design. These are goals that have their own backlogs and often - own component projects. These are objectives that cannot be completed in a single tactical iteration (i.e., a few days). Even if they can, it is convenient to treat them as separate projects.
- Backlog. On one hand, this is also a list of all other goals. On the other, the top of the backlog should include ALL current mandatory and priority goals of the domain, including those pulled from the backlogs of component projects. A backlog is always an up-to-date queue of goals to be executed within the domain, ordered so that the most critical goals are at the top.
- When the goals from the backlogs of component projects become relevant to the entire domain, they can be transferred to the backlogs of higher levels if it proves more convenient.

This organization allows for operating within the domain at various levels of abstraction — each time at the level most optimal for the current decision-making situation.
